<h2 id="mining-blocks">Mining Blocks</h2>

<p>Having registered as a miner, it&rsquo;s time to start making and checking tickets. At this point, the miner should already be running chain validation, which includes keeping track of the latest <a href="../expected-consensus#tipsets">TipSets</a> seen on the network.</p>

<p>For additional details around how consensus works in Filecoin, see the <a href="../expected-consensus">expected consensus spec</a>. For the purposes of this section, there is a consensus protocol (Expected Consensus) that guarantees a fair process for determining what blocks have been generated in a round, whether a miner should mine a block themselves, and some rules pertaining to how &ldquo;Tickets&rdquo; should be validated during block validation.</p>

<h3 id="ticket-generation">Ticket Generation</h3>

<p>For details of ticket generation, see the <a href="../expected-consensus#ticket-generation">expected consensus spec</a>.</p>

<p>New tickets are generated using the last ticket in the ticket-chain. Generating a new ticket will take some amount of time (as imposed by the VDF in Expected Consensus).</p>

<p>Because of this, on expectation, as it is produced, the miner will hear about other blocks being mined on the network. By the time they have generated their new ticket, they can check whether they themselves are eligible to mine a new block (see <a href="#block-creation">block creation</a>).</p>

<p>At any height <code>H</code>, there are three possible situations:
- The miner is eligible to mine a block: they produce their block and form a TipSet with it and other blocks received in this round (if there are any), and resume mining at the next height <code>H+1</code>.
- The miner is not eligible to mine a block but has received blocks: they form a TipSet with them and resume mining at the next height <code>H+1</code>.
- The miner is not eligible to mine a block and has received no blocks: they run leader election again, using:
    - their losing ticket from the last leader election to produce a new ticket (the <code>Tickets</code> array in the block to be published grows with each new ticket generated).
    - the ticket <code>H + 1 - K</code> blocks back to attempt to generate an <code>ElectionProof</code>.</p>

<p>This process is repeated until either a winning ticket is found (and block published) or a new valid TipSet comes in from the network.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s illustrate this with an example.</p>

<p>Miner M is mining at Height H.
Heaviest tipset at H-1 is {B0}
- New Round:
    - M produces a ticket at H, from B0&rsquo;s ticket (the min ticket at H-1)
    - M draws the ticket from height H-K to generate an ElectionProof
    - That ElectionProof is invalid
    - M has not heard about other blocks on the network.
- New Round:
    - M produces a ticket at H + 1 using the ticket produced at H last round.
    - M draws a ticket from height H+1-K to generate an ElectionProof
    - That ElectionProof is valid
    - M generates a block B1
    - M has received blocks B2, B3 from the network with the same parents and same height.
    - M forms a tipset {B1, B2, B3}
- Finding the new min ticket/extending the ticket chain:
    - M compares the final tickets in {B1,B2,B3} (each has two tickets in their <code>Tickets</code> array). B2 has the smallest final ticket. B2 should be used to extend the ticket chain, conceptually.
- New Round:
    - M produces a new ticket at H + 2 using B2&rsquo;s final ticket (the min final ticket in {B1, B2, B3})
    - M draws a ticket from H+2-K to generate an ElectionProof
    - That ElectionProof is invalid
    - M has received B4 from the network, mined atop {B1,B2,B3}
- New Round with M mining atop B4</p>

<p>Anytime a miner receives new blocks, it should evaluate which is the heaviest TipSet it knows about and mine atop it.</p>

<h3 id="block-creation">Block Creation</h3>

<p>Scratching a winning ticket, and armed with a valid <code>ElectionProof</code>, a miner can now publish a new block!</p>

<p>To create a block, the eligible miner must compute a few fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Tickets</code> - An array containing a new ticket, and, if applicable, any intermediary tickets generated to prove appropriate delay for any failed election attempts. See <a href="../expected-consensus#ticket-generation">ticket generation</a>.</li>
<li><code>ElectionProof</code> - A signature over the final ticket from the <code>Tickets</code> array proving. See <a href="../expected-consensus#checking-election-results">checking election results</a>.</li>
<li><code>ParentWeight</code> - As described in <a href="../expected-consensus#chain-weighting">Chain Weighting</a>.</li>
<li><code>Parents</code> - the CIDs of the parent blocks.</li>
<li><code>ParentState</code> - Note that it will not end up in the newly generated block, but is necessary to compute to generate other fields. To compute this:

<ul>
<li>Take the <code>ParentState</code> of one of the blocks in the chosen parent set (invariant: this is the same value for all blocks in a given parent set).</li>
<li>For each block in the parent set, ordered by their tickets:</li>
<li>Apply each message in the block to the parent state, in order. If a message was already applied in a previous block, skip it.</li>
<li>Transaction fees are given to the miner of the block that the first occurance of the message is included in. If there are two blocks in the parent set, and they both contain the exact same set of messages, the second one will receive no fees.</li>
<li>It is valid for messages in two different blocks of the parent set to conflict, that is, A conflicting message from the combined set of messages will always error.  Regardless of conflicts all messages are applied to the state.</li>
<li>TODO: define message conflicts in the state-machine doc, and link to it from here</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>MsgRoot</code> - To compute this:

<ul>
<li>Select a set of messages from the mempool to include in the block.</li>
<li>Separate the messages into BLS signed messages and secpk signed messages</li>
<li>For the BLS messages:</li>
<li>Strip the signatures off of the messages, and insert all the bare <code>Message</code>s for them into a sharray.</li>
<li>Aggregate all of the bls signatures into a single signature and use this to fill out the <code>BLSAggregate</code> field</li>
<li>For the secpk messages:</li>
<li>Insert each of the secpk <code>SignedMessage</code>s into a sharray</li>
<li>Create a <code>TxMeta</code> object and fill each of its fields as follows:</li>
<li><code>blsMessages</code>: the root cid of the bls messages sharray</li>
<li><code>secpkMessages</code>: the root cid of the secp messages sharray</li>
<li>The cid of this <code>TxMeta</code> object should be used to fill the <code>MsgRoot</code> field of the block header.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>BLSAggregate</code> - The aggregated signatures of all messages in the block that used BLS signing.</li>
<li><code>StateRoot</code> - Apply each chosen message to the <code>ParentState</code> to get this.

<ul>
<li>Note: first apply bls messages in the order that they appear in the blsMsgs sharray, then apply secpk messages in the order that they appear in the secpkMessages sharray.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>ReceiptsRoot</code> - To compute this:

<ul>
<li>Apply the set of messages to the parent state as described above, collecting invocation receipts as this happens.</li>
<li>Insert them into a sharray and take its root.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Timestamp</code> - A Unix Timestamp generated at block creation. We use an unsigned integer to represent a UTC timestamp (in seconds). The Timestamp in the newly created block must satisfy the following conditions:

<ul>
<li>the timestamp on the block is not in the future (with ALLOWABLE_CLOCK_DRIFT grace to account for relative asynchrony)</li>
<li>the timestamp on the block is at least BLOCK_DELAY * len(block.Tickets) higher than the latest of its parents, with BLOCK_DELAY taking on the same value as that needed to generate a valid VDF proof for a new Ticket (currently set to 30 seconds).</li>
<li>We also recommend the use of a networkTime() function to be booted on node launch and run every so frequently to call on a networked time service (e.g. ntp) and ensure relative synchrony with the rest of the network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>BlockSig</code> - A signature with the miner&rsquo;s private key (must also match the ticket signature) over the entire block. This is to ensure that nobody tampers with the block after it propagates to the network, since unlike normal PoW blockchains, a winning ticket is found independently of block generation.</li>
</ul>

<p>An eligible miner can start by filling out <code>Parents</code>, <code>Tickets</code> and <code>ElectionProof</code> with values from the ticket checking process.</p>

<p>Next, they compute the aggregate state of their selected parent blocks, the <code>ParentState</code>. This is done by taking the aggregate parent state of the blocks&rsquo; parent TipSet, sorting the parent blocks by their tickets, and applying each message in each block to that state. Any message whose nonce is already used (duplicate message) in an earlier block should be skipped (application of this message should fail anyway). Note that re-applied messages may result in different receipts than they produced in their original blocks, an open question is how to represent the receipt trie of this tipsets &lsquo;virtual block&rsquo;. For more details on message execution and state transitions, see the <a href="../state-machine">Filecoin state machine</a> document.</p>

<p>Once the miner has the aggregate <code>ParentState</code>, they must apply the block reward. This is done by adding the correct block reward amount to the miner owner&rsquo;s account balance in the state tree. The reward will be spendable immediately in this block. See <a href="#block-rewards">block reward</a> for details on how the block reward is structured. See <a href="#notes-on-block-reward-application">Notes on Block Reward Application</a> for some of the nuances in applying block rewards.</p>

<p>Now, a set of messages is selected to put into the block. For each message, the miner subtracts <code>msg.GasPrice * msg.GasLimit</code> from the sender&rsquo;s account balance, returning a fatal processing error if the sender does not have enough funds (this message should not be included in the chain).</p>

<p>They then apply the messages state transition, and generate a receipt for it containing the total gas actually used by the execution, the executions exit code, and the return value (see <a href="../data-structures#message-receipt">receipt</a> for more details). Then, they refund the sender in the amount of <code>(msg.GasLimit - GasUsed) * msg.GasPrice</code>. In the event of a message processing error, the remaining gas is refunded to the user, and all other state changes are reverted. (Note: this is a divergence from the way things are done in Ethereum)</p>

<p>Each message should be applied on the resultant state of the previous message execution, unless that message execution failed, in which case all state changes caused by that message are thrown out. The final state tree after this process will be the block&rsquo;s <code>StateRoot</code>.</p>

<p>The miner merklizes the set of messages selected, and put the root in <code>MsgRoot</code>. They gather the receipts from each execution into a set, merklize them, and put that root in <code>ReceiptsRoot</code>. Finally, they set the <code>StateRoot</code> field with the resultant state.</p>

<div class="notices info" >Note that the <code>ParentState</code> field from the expected consensus document is left out, this is to help minimize the size of the block header. The parent state for any given parent set should be computed by the client and cached locally.</div>

<p>Finally, the miner can generate a Unix Timestamp to add to their block, to show that the block generation was appropriately delayed.</p>

<p>The miner will wait until BLOCK_DELAY has passed since the latest block in the parent set was generated to timestamp and send out their block. We recommend using NTP or another clock synchronization protocol to ensure that the timestamp is correctly generated (lest the block be rejected). While this timestamp does not provide a hard proof that the block was delayed (we rely on the VDF in the ticket-chain to do so), it provides some softer form of block delay by ensuring that honest miners will reject undelayed blocks.</p>

<p>Now the block is complete, all that&rsquo;s left is to sign it. The miner serializes the block now (without the signature field), takes the sha256 hash of it, and signs that hash. They place the resultant signature in the <code>BlockSig</code> field.</p>

<h4 id="block-broadcast">Block Broadcast</h4>

<p>An eligible miner broadcasts the completed block to the network (via <a href="../data-propagation">block propagation</a>), and assuming everything was done correctly, the network will accept it and other miners will mine on top of it, earning the miner a block reward!</p>

<h3 id="block-rewards">Block Rewards</h3>

<p>Over the entire lifetime of the protocol, 1,400,000,000 FIL (<code>TotalIssuance</code>) will be given out to miners. The rate at which the funds are given out is set to halve every six years, smoothly (not a fixed jump like in Bitcoin). These funds are initially held by the network account actor, and are transferred to miners in blocks that they mine. The reward amount remains fixed for a period of 1 week (given our 30 second block time, this  is 20,160 blocks, the <code>AdjustmentPeriod</code>) and is then adjusted. Over time, the reward will eventually become zero as the fractional amount given out at each step shrinks the network account&rsquo;s balance to 0.</p>

<p>The equation for the current block reward is of the form:</p>

<pre><code>Reward = IV * (Decay ^ (BlockHeight / 20160))
</code></pre>

<p><code>IV</code> is the initial value, and is computed by taking:</p>

<pre><code>IV = TotalIssuance * (1 - Decay)
</code></pre>

<p><code>Decay</code> is computed by:</p>

<pre><code>Decay = e^(ln(0.5) / (HalvingPeriodBlocks / AdjustmentPeriod))
</code></pre>

<pre><code>// Given one block every 30 seconds, this is how many blocks are in six years
HalvingPeriodBlocks = 6 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 2 = 6,307,200 blocks
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Due to jitter in EC, and the gregorian calendar, there may be some error in the issuance schedule over time. This is expected to be small enough that it&rsquo;s not worth correcting for. Additionally, since the payout mechanism is transferring from the network account to the miner, there is no risk of minting <em>too much</em> FIL.</p>

<p>TODO: Ensure that if a miner earns a block reward while undercollateralized, then <code>min(blockReward, requiredCollateral-availableBalance)</code> is garnished (transfered to the miner actor instead of the owner).</p>

<h3 id="notes-on-block-reward-application">Notes on Block Reward Application</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, every round, a miner checks to see if they have been selected as the leader for that particular round (see <a href="../expected-consensus#secret-leader-election">Secret Leader Election</a> in the Expected Consensus spec for more detail). Thus, it is possible that multiple miners may be selected as winners in a given round, and thus, that there will be multiple blocks with the same parents that are produced at the same block height (forming a TipSet). Each of the winning miners will apply the block reward directly to their actor&rsquo;s state in their state tree.</p>

<p>Other nodes will receive these blocks and form a TipSet out of the eligible blocks (those that have the same parents and are at the same block height). These nodes will then validate the TipSet. The full procedure for how to verify a TipSet can be found above in <a href="#block-validation">Block Validation</a>. To validate TipSet state, the validating node will, for each block in the TipSet, first apply the block reward value directly to the mining node&rsquo;s account and then apply the messages contained in the block.</p>

<p>Thus, each of the miners who produced a block in the TipSet will receive a block reward. There will be no lockup. These rewards can be spent immediately.</p>

<p>Messages in Filecoin also have an associated transaction fee (based on the gas costs of executing the message). In the case where multiple winning miners included the same message in their blocks, only the first miner will be paid this transaction fee. The first miner is the miner with the lowest ticket value (sorted lexicographically). More details on message execution can be found in the <a href="../state-machine#execution-calling-a-method-on-an-actor">State Machine spec</a>.</p>
